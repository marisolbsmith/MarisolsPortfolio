# MarisolsPortfolio
I've created this portfolio to show a part of me and the skills that I have accumalated in this short time. I included a link to my Linkedin and Github, also a picture to put a face to this portfolio. If you would like a short cut to the bottom of the page for my info you can also click "Contact me" at the top of the page. Although it is simple and I would prefer to make a few changes to make this look a little more advanced I am happy with how it came out and how I have implememnted the tools we have learned in a very basic but exicutional way.
